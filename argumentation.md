# **Argumentation: Stasis, Support, Assumptions, Counter-Arguments**

Let’s build a shared vocabulary for understanding how people argue.

## **Stasis: a Way to Zero In on the Most Salient Issue** 

Have you ever participated in or witnessed an argument where the participants seemed to “talk past each other” or to not even agree about what was at issue? Have you ever struggled to come up with ideas, especially when asked to work with other peoples’ texts? Of course you have. People have been experiencing those same phenomena as long as humans have been using language. 

Ancient rhetoricians developed a simple yet powerful system for understanding what is, or could be, at issue in a particular situation. They called this system stasis (STAH-sis). Stasis is a system for identifying and zeroing in on issues and for understanding, focusing, or creating an argument. 

Various systems have been formulated over the centuries and updated or contextualized for different situations. Rather than try to adopt a particular system that has been offered over the years, I want you to think of stasis as **a useful system for understanding and coming up with ideas and for avoiding misunderstandings**. In this course, here are the ideas that you need to know about stasis:

* Stasis is a range of possibilities for inventing claims and focusing an argument.  
* If a writer and audience are going to have a meaningful, relevant exchange (an explanation, an argument, or something else), they should first be on the same page about **what the issue is** and **how to explain or argue about it.**   
  * You have no doubt heard and used the sayings *we’re not on the same page* or *comparing apples to oranges* before. Those common sayings are expressions of the idea that there was no basic agreement yet on what the issue was or how to argue about it.  
* Stasis is best thought of as a system of asking questions across a spectrum from foundational to complex. 

The writer and audience must agree, at least provisionally, on the foundational issues before moving to the complex levels.  For example, if you want to argue that the US government should develop defenses against the dire threat of werewolves, you have to first have some agreement that a) werewolves exist and b) are a threat at all, let alone a dire one. Otherwise, a policy argument of what to do about werewolves is going to lead to misunderstandings and be premature anyway.  

### **The Stasis Spectrum** 

* Shifting from the left (more foundational) to the right (more complex) on the spectrum of stasis shifts perspectives and possibilities.   
* Misunderstandings often arise when a writer (or speaker) and audience shift from one stasis to another abruptly. 

The spectrum runs from the most foundational stasis to the most complex: 

* Existence   
* Definition  
* Cause/Effect  
* Worth  
* Comparison  
* Policy or Procedure

| More foundational |  |  |  |  |  More Complex |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Existence Stasis** | **Definition Stasis** | **Cause/Effect Stasis** | **Worth Stasis** | **Comparison Stasis** | **Policy or Procedure Stasis** |
|  What core facts can we agree about regarding the existence of the issue or phenomenon?  To what extent are we arguing from common understandings of reality?  | How should we name or define the issue or phenomenon?  What are the implications of labeling it one way or another?  | What brought about this issue or phenomenon? Where did it come from?  What are the effects or implications of this issue or phenomenon?  | Is this issue or phenomenon good, bad, or mixed?  How do we determine that? |  What can be learned by comparing this issue or phenomenon with another?  What is the worth of this issue or phenomenon compared to another?  How can we better understand this issue or phenomenon by examining another? |  What should be done to address this issue or phenomenon? Why is that the thing to do? How is doing that feasible? How will we know whether it was effective? Who has the authority or ability to come up with and implement policy? Are there proper steps that need to be followed? |

The stases help you to identify what is, or could be, at issue and form the basis of your own claims. They also will call for different kinds of support for arguments. 

## **Support** 

You sometimes hear people say, “I would argue that….” and then make a claim. For example, someone might say, “I would argue that LeBron James is the greatest NBA player of all time.” Or “I would argue that this policy, despite intentions, actually makes inflation worse.” Often, no support is offered, though presumably, it could be offered if you ask a simple question: “Why?” When someone asks “Why?” or “What makes you say that?” or a similar question, they are indicating that they resist (or do not yet see) the connection between the claim and the support for the claim. 

In arguing, the arguer is asking their audience to go on a journey, a movement from where the audience is right now to where the arguer invites them to be. In the first example above, the arguer is saying “Come join me over here, where we accept that LeBron James is the greatest NBA player of all time.” In the second example, the arguer is saying “Come join me over here, where we accept that this policy worsens inflation.” So unless the audience already accepts the claim and the support for the claim, the arguer will likely have to provide support for it. **Support is what makes the journey from where the audience is now to where the arguer is inviting them to be possible**.

* What support might be offered for the claim that LeBron James is the greatest NBA player of all time? *Notice that what we call “support” might shift*. What seems to count the most? The number of championships won by teams he has been a part of? His contributions to other teammates’ success? The overall win-loss record of teams when he is in the game? His salary and endorsements? His philanthropy? You can see that, pretty quickly, you might have to deal with the preliminary issue of the criteria for “greatness” and maybe refine the term to something more concrete and mutually understandable as constituting support. But presumably, you and the arguer could come to an understanding of what kinds of support might make a journey from **where you are now** over to **where the arguer is inviting you to be**: statistics, percentages, the strength of the team’s scheduled opponents, etc.  
* What support might be offered for the claim that a particular policy, despite the intentions of its proponents, actually makes inflation worse, not better? Again, you might have to settle on how and when “worsening” occurs, and by how much (and for whom). But it should not be too difficult to see that you and the arguer might agree on what could support their claim: economic data, similar policies in the past, expert conclusions, and so on. 

| So we see that support is evidence, data, analysis, or accepted authorities that make the journey over from where the audience is now over to where the arguer is inviting them to be more or less reliable. Support answers the *Why?* question.  It serves the *because…*. function.  |
| :---- |

LeBron James is the greatest NBA player of all time because……

This policy, despite intentions, will worsen inflation because….

### **The STAR Questions (Sufficiency, Typicality, Accuracy, and Relevance)** 

Because support is the basis for the audience possibly moving over to join the writer in accepting the claim, the quality, quantity, and relevance of the support are crucial. 

**Think of support as the bridge that could take the audience from where they are now over to join the rhetor**. If a bridge has too little material, or the material is rotten or defective, or it’s the wrong kind of material (would you walk across a bridge made of marshmallows?), problems arise. 

One way to figure out how, or if, a claim is supported is to ask **the STAR questions**. STAR is a shorthand mnemonic device that helps you remember four sets of ideas: **Sufficiency, Typicality, Accuracy, and Relevance**.

Ask these questions:

| Questions about Sufficiency-S | Questions about Typicality-T  | Questions about Accuracy-A  | Questions About Relevance-R |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| How much support is offered for this claim? Is this the kind of claim that might require a lot of support? How carefully is the claim stated; does it match the quantity of support offered or go far beyond it? | Is this the type of support that typically connects to such claims?  Is this the wrong kind of support for this purpose? Is this a non-representative, extreme example? | Is this the best, most direct support? Is this support as current as it needs to be? Does this support appear to have errors?  | Does the support actually support this particular claim?  Does it support a claim that is “kind of” like this one, but not really this claim? |

### **Different Standards for What Counts as Support** 

Different readers expect different kinds of support for different kinds of claims. What counts as support varies and depends on context and on what readers have come to expect. 

For example, in scientific and technical writing, typical kinds of support might include experimental data, statistical analyses, or reviews of previous research. In social science, nursing, or business writing, typical kinds of support might include case studies, interviews, survey data, or focus groups. In humanities writing, typical kinds of support might include direct use of textual authorities, close reading and analysis, reflection, or narrative. In legal writing, typical support includes citation to sources of law (cases, statutes, etc.), logical analysis, analogy and disanalogy, and a lot of arguing over the story told by the facts.

All of those kinds of support can be used across disciplines and writing occasions. They are not the exclusive property or way of supporting arguments belonging to particular writers. So you might read humanistic writing that uses statistical analysis and medical writing that uses narrative. But fundamentally, when writers ask readers to make a journey from **where they are now** over to **where the writer is inviting them to be**, the support is capable of being understood and tested using the STAR questions. 

## **Assumptions** 

Arguments function with claims and support, and you can ask the STAR questions about the connection between claims and support. You will be expected, in your work in this class, to craft explicit, clear, well-supported arguments. But you should also always **look out for what is taken for granted** in any text. All arguments have to assume something; otherwise an infinite regress of "Why?" questions would forever defer the argument from getting launched in the first place. 

*Ask: what does the arguer seem to be taking for granted that their listeners or readers will already accept?* A clear sense of what is taken for granted is a powerful tool for understanding any kind of communication, including texts. It also underscores the need for you to understand writing in context. Surfacing the implicit, unspoken ideas in writing and working through their implications is central to understanding and working with written arguments. 

##  **Writing a Counter-Argument** 

### **No Strawmanning** 

You will often be asked, as you are in this course, to include counter-arguments in your writing. A counter-argument explains the arguments that oppose yours, gives them fair treatment, and establishes why, on balance, your argument is more acceptable. 

A counter-argument has to deal with the **best version** of the arguments that oppose yours. If you construct opposing arguments unfairly in an effort to make them appear weaker than they are, that is the argumentative sin called “strawmanning” (it’s easier to knock down a man made of straw than a real man). You have probably heard of strawmanning before. 

While strawmanning might work when writing for weak readers, especially those who already agree with you, it will ultimately be an ineffective strategy. All you need is one alert reader who will see that you have strawmanned. Boom\! There goes your credibility. In addition to being potentially ineffective, strawmanning is also simply unethical because it is a form of deception.

If you have a well-considered, worthwhile argument to make, **it can withstand engagement with opposing arguments** (even if it might lose when put in front of a third party for judgment). But if your argument cannot withstand engagement with opposing arguments without your feeling the need to mischaracterize opposing arguments, you need to work on improving your own claim and support. 

### **How to Write a Counter-Argument** 

 Nobody is born knowing how to write a counter-argument. Here are tips on writing a counter-argument in this class:

1. Clearly and fairly summarize opposing arguments.   
   * A good test for this is to imagine whether the writer of the opposing argument would agree that your summary is fair and does not mischaracterize their claim or support. If not, then your counterargument will be dismissed as strawmanning.  
2. Clearly and fairly examine the connections between opposing claims and the evidence offered to support them.   
   * How many (quantity) and how good (quality) are the connections between opposing claims and support?  
   * Concede, if warranted, any, features of the opposing argument that are well-supported.   
     * Is any part of their claim or support acceptable? If so, what?   
       * What do you agree on, if anything?  
       * Some ways to get started on concessions can be found in [this handout from the Kentucky Writing Project](http://www.kentuckywritingproject.com/uploads/2/7/8/7/27877037/they_say,_i_say_templates.pdf)t, which is based on a popular book titled *They Say/I Say*.  
3. State clearly and fairly why, on balance, your argument is better supported.   
   * An argument can be better supported on balance without all other arguments being totally off-base and worthless. It’s not always a zero-sum game, despite what our infantile media-fueled culture of people shouting past one another might suggest. **In fact, the more interesting and important the issue, the more likely it is that well-supported arguments are being made that disagree with one another**. Your goal in classes such as this one is to show why your argument is better supported rather than why the opposing arguments are terrible and written by bad people who should hide their faces in shame. 

| Clear, fair summary of opposing arguments, *followed by*… | Clear, fair examination of claims and support with any warranted concessions, *followed by*… | Why your argument is better supported |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
